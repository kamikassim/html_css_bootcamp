        <p> Operation Hot Mother. My brother wasn't optimistic it could be done, but I didn't take "wasn't optimistic it could be done" for an answer. Yeah, like I'm going to take a whiz through this $5,000 suit. COME ON. 
            Annyong. Touché, Pandora. GENE!! [screams] Stop licking my hand, you horse's ass! Don't worry, these young beauties have been nowhere near the bananas. Sure, let the little fruit do it. HUZZAH!</p>               
        <p> A trick is something a whore does for money…or candy.  … or cocaine. Let me take off my assistant's skirt and put on my Barbra-Streisand-in-The-Prince-of-Tides ass-masking therapist pantsuit. You just grab that brownish area by its points and you don't let go no matter what your mother tells you! Chickens don't clap! 
            Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. Annhog's coming? And although the intervention didn't work, it turned into one of the Bluth family's better parties. And that is why Jesus was often referred to as the King of Kings. Queens. The King of Queens. You just grab that brownish area by its points and you don't let go no matter what your mother tells you! I know, I just call her Annabelle cause she's shaped like a…she's the belle of the ball! You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk? I got Michael out of his marriage, didn't I? Actually, she died.        
            Whenever she'd change clothes, she'd make me wait on the balcony until zip-up, and yet anything goes at bath time. Please refrain from discussing or engaging in any sort of interoffice [bleep] or [bleep] or finger[bleep] or [bleep]sting or [bleep] or even [bleep]. So maybe you could start jete-ing, and stop je-terrorizing me! No, no, it's pronounced a-nal-ra-pist. It wasn't really the pronunciation that bothered me. That's so you can videotape it when they put you in a naked pyramid and point to your Charlie Browns. Let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar. 
        <p> A sea of waiters and no one will take a drink order. It's ok. You be with Yam. He… she… what's the difference? Oh hear, hear. In the dark, it all looks the same. Early. Wow. We're just blowing through nap time, aren't we? It's sort of like going from prime rib to… I don't know… weird brother of prime rib. I didn't get into this business to please sophomore Tracy Schwartzman, so… onward and upward. On… Why, Tracy?! Why?!! But where did the lighter fluid come from? When a man needs to prove to a woman that he's actually… When a man loves a woman… </p>
            O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? ♪♪ And the thought of rubbin' you is getting so exciting. Sky rockets in flight! Afternoon delight! ♪♪ She keeps saying that God is going to show me a sign. The… something of my ways. Wisdom? It's probably wisdom. A million ****ing diamonds! Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar. You can control your bladder when you're dead! Dad asked me to do this on the day he pleads not guilty, as a spectacular protest. A…. ? </p>    
        <p> Here he comes. Here comes John Wayne. Shémale. Mission Accomplished. Ohhh little guy. The tears aren't coming. The tears just aren't coming. Mom always taught us to curl up in a ball and remain motionless when confronted. 
            Everything they do is so dramatic and flamboyant. It just makes me want to set myself on fire. - Lucille Bluth. Operation Hot Mother. I didn't mean who… I meant… her? Up yours, granny! You couldn't handle it! Oh Gob, you could charm the black off a telegram boy.       
            Chaw-chee, chaw-chee chaw-chee! Coo coo ca cha! Ah coodle doodle do Caw ca caw, caw ca caw. I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with "Fuck Mountain." If you don't start pulling your weight around here its going to be shape up, or…ship up. Smack of ham. What is she doing at a beauty pageant? Is she running the lights or something? When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he's actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. Michael, I'm your older brother. I'll never be proud of you. There are very few intelligent, attractive and straight men in this town. Well, that certainly leaves me out. </p>
